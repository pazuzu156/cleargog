# cleargog

ClearGOG is a simple tool that removes GOG games from your start menu.

GOG Galaxy puts shortcuts in your start menu by default, and there's no way to
disable this feature. This tool is used to clean your start menu up from 
unwanted game shortcuts GOG Galaxy places there.

## Running:

simply run the cleargog.exe and go through each GOG related shortcut to keep or
remove

## Building:

cleargog is built in C#, using WPF as it's GUI toolkit and built with .NET Core.
An installation of the .NET Core 3 SDK is needed to build. Afterwords, simply run
the build.bat script


## Also:

gog.ico is the Galaxy 2.0 icon, and was taken from my Galaxy install, and is not
my creation, it's CD Projekt's
