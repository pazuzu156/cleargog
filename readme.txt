cleargog

ClearGOG is a simple tool that removes GOG games from your start menu.

GOG Galaxy puts shortcuts in your start menu by default, and there's no way to
disable this feature. This tool is used to clean your start menu up from 
unwanted game shortcuts GOG Galaxy places there.

Running:

simply run the cleargog.exe and go through each GOG related shortcut to keep or
remove

Building:

cleargog is built in Go, so Go version 1.14+ is needed as well as a copy of 
windres for building the resource file


Also:

gog.ico is the Galaxy 2.0 icon, and was taken from my Galaxy install, and is not
my creation, it's CD Projekt's
